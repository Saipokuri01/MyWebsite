    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <div class="container">
      <p>I am Albert Einstein, a physicist born in Germany in 1879. My groundbreaking theory of relativity, symbolized
        by the famous equation E=mc^2, transformed the foundations of physics. Beyond my scientific work, I dedicated
        myself to advocating for peace and civil rights, striving to make the world a better place. My legacy stands as
        that of a scientist and humanitarian who left an indelible mark on the 20th century.</p>

        <h3>Quantum Mechanics</h3>
        <p>By 1926, Albert Einstein had become completely unforgiving of quantum mechanics’ probabilistic interpretation
          of the universe and would step away from it forever.
          In Einstein’s mind, the universe must ultimately obey laws of physics that are fundamentally deterministic,
          and with respect to this, he would be uncompromising. Einstein made this most clear in response to a letter
          Max Born (1882–1970) had written to him when he said:</p>
        <p class="quantum">
          Quantum mechanics is very impressive. But an inner voice tells me that it is not yet the real thing. The
          theory produces a good deal but hardly brings us closer to the secret of the Old One. I am at all events
          convinced that He does not play dice.

        <h3>Energy-Mass Equation</h3>
        <p>Einstein's Mass-Energy Equation is a scholarly treatment, quite distinct from the run-of-the-mill trade books
          that have E = mc2 emblazoned on their covers, and too often almost nothing redemptive inside. Interestingly,
          Fernflores discusses a number of philosophical issues associated with the concepts of mass and energy: are the
          two equivalent, interconvertible, conserved, and so forth. Alas, he is not a storyteller, and so the reader
          will not get much help in learning how the modern interpretation of E = mc2 evolved; intense scrutiny of
          detail has led to a bit of myopia regarding trees, and not seeing the forest. Still, as a physicist, I
          especially enjoyed Fernflores's philosophical asides and insights.</p>
